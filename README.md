AdvancedAutoclicker is a fully customizable Autoclicker with random delays to bypass Anti-Autoclicker systems!
quite literally bypasses every autoclicker check


## How to use (For newbies):
### Create a new folder (Name it anything you want) and put 'advancedautoclick.py' in it.
### After it, open it in a code editor (make sure you have python, python comes with a dedicated code editor called IDLE so you can use that)
### Once you are in your code editor, if you are using IDLE then you should see a run button, click it and you are good to go
### For other code editors please search how to execute python files.
